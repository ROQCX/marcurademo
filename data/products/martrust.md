### Example 2: Port Agent Payment Optimization
A fleet operator receives invoices from port agents worldwide. Instead of processing individual wire transfers with high FX fees, they use MarTrust to batch payments, benefiting from better exchange rates and reduced transaction costs.

### Example 3: Crew Card Expense Management
A vessel operator issues MarTrust prepaid cards to crew members for onboard expenses. Crew can use the cards at approved vendors, and the operator receives real-time transaction data, simplifying expense tracking and reconciliation.
