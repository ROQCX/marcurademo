- Review and approve port agent invoices
- Track cash advances and payments
- Monitor account balances across multiple ports
- Generate comprehensive port call reports

### Cost Transparency
DA-Desk provides detailed breakdowns of port costs, including:

- Bunkering costs
- Crew changes and provisions
- Repairs and maintenance expenses

### Benefits
- Reduced manual data entry and reconciliation
- Faster invoice processing and approval workflows
- Better cost visibility and budget control

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Port Call Cost Monitoring
A fleet manager receives a notification that a vessel has arrived at port. They log into DA-Desk and see real-time updates of all expenses being incurred. They notice that bunkering costs are higher than expected and can immediately contact the port agent to verify the charges before the vessel departs.

### Example 2: Multi-Port Disbursement Tracking
A shipowner operating vessels across multiple regions uses DA-Desk to monitor disbursement accounts in ports across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. They can quickly compare costs across ports, identify cost-saving opportunities, and ensure all accounts are properly reconciled.

### Example 3: Budget vs. Actual Analysis
Before a scheduled port call, an operations team sets a budget in DA-Desk. As the port call progresses, they track actual costs against the budget in real-time. After the vessel departs, they generate a report showing budget variances and use this data to improve future cost estimates.
